### You can access the live version of this project [here](https://book-list-gql-mern.herokuapp.com).  

After you visit the link, you can view the books list.  

You can also view the details of the author and other books from the same author that are on the list.  

You can also add books that belong to the authors.  

The app uses *GraphQL* in the backend for CRUD operations of the app.  

The app uses *MongoDB* provided by [mLab](https://mlab.com) to host the data needed by the app.  

The app uses *React / Apollo* in the frontend which requests  *GraphQL* in the backend to get data.  

Finally, the app is deployed on *Heroku*.
